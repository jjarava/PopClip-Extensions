# PopClip Send to Drafts Extension README

This extension for [PopClip][pclip] will take the selected text and create a new Draft in [Drafts for Mac][dm].

To do that, it uses the "Send to Drafts" extension that Drafts for Mac installs.

For "how this works", I've used as a base the example "Service" extension that [PopClip docs point][ppdoc], ["MakeSticky"][ms].

The usual caveats: works for me, don't blame me if this blows up your computer, etc, etc...
